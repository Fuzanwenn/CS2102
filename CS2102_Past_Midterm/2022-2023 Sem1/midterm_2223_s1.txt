Q1.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW q1 ( num_subzones ) AS
SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM subzones
WHERE area = 'bukit merah'
AND population > 15000
;

Q2.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW q2 ( area ) AS
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM areas
WHERE region = 'central'
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT A.name
FROM areas A JOIN subzones S
ON A.name = S.area
JOIN mrt_stations M
ON S.name = M.subzone
WHERE A.region = 'central'
;

Q3.
不用JOIN areas

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW q3 ( area , num_stops ) AS
SELECT DISTINCT A.name, COUNT(Stops.code)
FROM mrt_stops Stops RIGHT JOIN mrt_stations Stations
ON Stops.station = Stations.name
RIGHT JOIN subzones S ON S.name = Stations.subzone
RIGHT JOIN areas A ON A.name = S.area
GROUP BY A.name
ORDER BY COUNT(Stops.code) DESC
LIMIT 3
;

Q4.
三个table JOIN就完了，太复杂！

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW q4 ( mrt_station ) AS
SELECT DISTINCT Stops.station
FROM mrt_stops Stops
WHERE Stops.line = 'ew'
AND EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM mrt_connections Connection
WHERE Connection.from_code = Stops.code
AND Connection.to_code NOT IN (
SELECT code
FROM mrt_stops
WHERE line = 'ew')
)
;

Q5.
不用JOIN areas

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW q5 ( area , num_lines ) AS
SELECT DISTINCT A.name, COUNT(DISTINCT Stops.line)
FROM areas A JOIN subzones S ON A.name = S.area
JOIN mrt_stations Stations ON Stations.subzone = S.name
JOIN mrt_stops Stops ON Stops.station = Stations.name
GROUP BY A.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Stops.line) >= 3
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT Stops.line) DESC
;
